    <p class="desc"> A hackathon is a 24-hour event where students come together in
small teams to work on projects. The purpose of a hackathon is to have students learn
about idea development and product design by being provided resources like hardware,
workshops, and mentors. Hackathons are ultimately a collaborative space where creativity is
encouraged and self-confidence can be obtained through hands on learning. </p>
